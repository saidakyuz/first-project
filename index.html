        <p>
          Jodi Ettenberg of Legal Nomads quit her job as an attorney back in
          2008 to pursue her dream of long-term travel. She writes about how, in
          her words, “people can learn about how food shapes what we see and
          experience, and how it deepens knowledge about culture and history.”
          Jodi writes about gluten-free dishes as well as those that include
          gluten from all over the world. Her affinity for soup borders on
          obsession, but that isn’t surprising given how good it looks in her
          photos.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jodi’s imagery-laden writing style and open sense of humor make it
          feel as if you’re sitting in the plastic chair at a street food table
          next to her. As far as food journalism and storytelling goes, she is
          one of the most talented and dedicated writers you’ll find. Some of my
          favorites include her Guide to Saigon Street Food and the advice she
          gives on How to Eat Street Food Without Getting Sick.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you enjoy Jodi’s site, take a look at some of her recent hand drawn
          foodie posters in the shape of some of her favorite countries.
